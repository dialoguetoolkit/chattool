# Getting started

The project should run "out of the box" in netbeans (as a Maven project).

The project contains a pom.xml file that contains a list of all the dependencies.

## Starting the server

To start the server, use ```java -jar "chattool.jar SERVER``` 

The server will listen for incoming connections on port 20000

To change this, use ```java -jar "chattool.jar SERVER  %PORTNUMBER%```  where %PORTNUMBER% is the portnumber

it is advisable to read through the "quick start" sections in the user manual before programming the chattool!


## Starting the client 

### Telegram clients

Please follow the instructions in the [usermanual](docs/usermanual/usermanual.pdf)

### Non-telegram clients

To start a client from the commandline you need to specify the IP address and port number to connect to, e.g.

```java -jar "chattool.jar" CLIENT localhost 20000```

which would connect to localhost (the local machine) on port 20000

It is also possible to start clients (locally) from the server GUI by selecting the button "Additional Client"  (please see the user manual how to do this)
